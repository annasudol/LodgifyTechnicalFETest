This is a Lodgify - FE Technical Challenge.

The project was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
A web link deployed with Vercel: [simpleform-flame.vercel.app](https://simpleform-flame.vercel.app/)

To complete that task I used Next.js with Typescript and Tailwind. I tried to be as close as possible to the design but I couldn't find the font 'Source Sans Pro' free to download so I used similar.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
